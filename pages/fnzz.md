## Funü zazhi (The Ladies' Journal)

Funü zazhi (The Ladies’ Journal) was a prominent women’s magazine published in China from 1915 to 1931. It played a key role in advocating for women’s education, independence, and participation in public life during a time of social and cultural transformation. The magazine combined essays, literature, and practical advice, addressing topics like gender equality, family dynamics, and international feminist movements. As part of the New Culture Movement, Funü zazhi was instrumental in promoting modern feminist ideas and remains an essential source for studying the history of feminism in early 20th-century China.

Here are some of the scanned pages of Funü zazhi:
