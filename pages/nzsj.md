## Nüzi shijie (Women's World)

The Nüzi shijie provides an important window into crucial issues concerning women and gender relations in the rapidly changing Late Qing society. The main editors and writers for the journal consist of progressive young men active in the immediate post-1898 reform period who promoted the development of women’s education and women’s rights as vital measures for China’s national salvation. In their support for women’s education, they were outspoken critics of footbinding and advocates of freedom of marriage; some of them were involved in teaching or administering women’s schools. Many of their views are reflected in the editorials and other columns in the Nüzi shijie.The journal also solicited contributions from women. Those who responded appear to be new-style educators, students, and readers, and they wrote chiefly poems and essays.

Here are some of the scanned pages of Nüzi shijie:
