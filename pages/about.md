## About the Collection

This collection is a resource that presents the dynamic and transformative period of early 20th-century Chinese history through the lens of the commercial periodical press, focusing specifically on women’s and gendered magazines. These magazines, published between 1904 and 1937, include Nüzi Shijie (Women’s World, 1904–07), Funü Shibao (The Women’s Eastern Times, 1911–17), Funü Zazhi (The Ladies’ Journal, 1915–31), and Linglong (Elegance, 1931–37). They were pivotal in spreading knowledge and shaping culture, making them indispensable for understanding evolving concepts such as hygiene, the "new woman," and literary forms like free-verse poetry. 
This collection serves as both a research tool and a narrative framework, appealing to scholars of cultural, literary, and women's history, as well as students and non-experts. It provides a nuanced view of Chinese history, challenging stereotypes and offering a deeper understanding of the cultural currents that shaped modern China.

Examples of these four magazines:
