## Linglong (Elegance/La Petite)
Linglong ( Elegance or La Petite) was a popular Chinese women’s magazine published weekly from 1931 to 1937. Targeting urban, middle-class women, the magazine was known for its compact format and rich content, including articles on fashion, beauty, relationships, family life, and modern lifestyles.
Linglong stood out for its visual appeal, with a heavy emphasis on photographs and illustrations, reflecting the influence of Western aesthetics while addressing the aspirations of modern Chinese women. It also provided short stories, serialized novels, and advice columns that resonated with its readership. The magazine is a valuable resource for understanding women’s culture and urban modernity in Republican-era China.
