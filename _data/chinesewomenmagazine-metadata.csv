nzsj002,nzsj_vol001_issue01.jpg,Discussing Freedom in Marriage,image/jpeg,"This is an article from Nüzi shijie. Detailed content: Free marriage is not something that can be easily achieved. Women in Chinese society have long been restricted by outdated customs, viewed as ""things"", which is truly regrettable. Free marriage requires individuals to be self-disciplined and economically independent. Those who cannot support themselves are neither able to enjoy the freedom of marriage nor should they seek it. If a marriage is not built on true love between both parties, it will not only harm their feelings but also bring negative effects to their family, nation, ethnicity, and society. Therefore, the issue of free marriage deserves in-depth study.",Zhuang Gong,1904,no,Nüzi Shijie (Women's World) ,"Beijing,CN",39.91946138,116.4152418,University of Heidelberg,Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes. ,Image;StillImage,zh-Hant
nzsj003,nzsj_vol001_issue02.jpg,Prohibition of Women from Foot Binding,image/jpeg,"This is an article from Nüzi shijie. Detailed content: When Governor Zhou served as the provincial governor of Dong Province, he issued strict orders prohibiting women from foot binding. In Dong Province, this ban had already been enforced. However, in the Jiangnan region, from Governor Wei to Governor Duan, these officials had all issued proclamations urging people to stop foot binding, yet this outdated and deeply rooted practice has not been completely eradicated. Recently, Governor Zhou reiterated the ban, explicitly forbidding foot binding. However, without local gentry and women from officials' families taking the lead in advocating against it, relying solely on official proclamations will likely be ineffective.",Pan Huayu,1904,no,Nüzi Shijie (Women's World) ,"Beijing,CN",39.91946138,116.4152418,University of Heidelberg,Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes. ,Image;StillImage,zh-Hant

fnsb002,fnsb_vol001_issue01.jpg,Women’s Self-Defense Methods,image/jpeg,"This is an article from Funü shibao. Detailed content: More than ten years ago, people in western countries paid great attention to physical exercise. Every morning, they would practice with dumbbells or engage in other exercises, often purchasing equipment for training. Although physical training brings many benefits, it was not commonly seen as a means of self-defense at that time. Today, we should reflect on the importance of daily physical exercise, as it has significant advantages for our health. In recent years, the number of people practicing such exercises has been steadily increasing. However, recent news frequently reports incidents such as fraud, robbery, and violent crimes, occurring almost daily and becoming more severe than before. Among these cases, many victims, especially women, suffer harm because they lack the self-defense skills they could have developed through regular practice. Whether it is day or night, knowing how to protect oneself is crucial. This highlights the significance of women learning self-defense skills.",Xia Hua,1914,no,Funü Shibao (Women's Eastern Times),"Shanghai,CN",31.239106873462955,121.46545276739948,University of Heidelberg,Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes. ,Image;StillImage,zh-Hant
fnsb003,fnsb_vol001_issue02.jpg,What I Expect of Women in Their Time of Study,image/jpeg,"This is an article from Funü shibao. Detailed content: Women should develop independence and self-discipline, particularly in managing their own thoughts and lives, without relying on others. Virtue and character are invaluable treasures that cannot be measured by money, and they must be achieved through practical actions and self-restraint. Women should strive for independence, self-discipline, and strong character, so they are no longer seen as mere accessories or playthings in society.",Zhang Wanying,1914,no,Funü Shibao (Women's Eastern Times),"Shanghai,CN",31.239106873462955,121.46545276739948,University of Heidelberg,Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes. ,Image;StillImage,zh-Hant

fnzz002,fnzz_vol007_issue01.jpg,Women’s Liberation is Women’s Own Responsibility,image/jpeg,"This is an article from Funü zazhi. Detailed cotent: Women’s liberation is a responsibility that rests on women themselves, not something granted by men. It requires women to free themselves from male-imposed constraints through self-driven efforts, particularly education. This education must be autonomous and creative, fostering self-respect and self-worth. Women must recognize that true freedom comes at a cost and cannot be passively obtained. For example, the inclusion of women at Oxford University demonstrates how progress in education and self-awareness can lead to greater opportunities and liberation. Ultimately, the key to women’s emancipation lies in their own awakening and actions.",Anonymous,1915,no,Funü zazhi (The Ladies' Journal),"Guangzhou,CN",23.15336590501664,113.5769600498724,University of Heidelberg,Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes. ,Image;StillImage,zh-Hant
fnzz003,fnzz_vol001_issue02.jpg,Women's Education Should Focus on Morality,image/jpeg,"This is an article from Funü zazhi. Detailed content: I’ve noticed that women’s education in Western countries is rapidly developing, changing every day. Not only in family education, but women’s education is also becoming the mainstream in society. Women are now involved in fields like business, military affairs, and finance, and some even hold political assistant roles. China is currently facing many challenges and a serious shortage of talent, so we should place greater importance on women’s education, nurturing exceptional talents to help lay the foundation for the revival of society and the strengthening of the nation. For those who believe women’s education is unimportant, these misconceptions can easily be refuted. However, in some remote areas, these ideas may still exist, so it’s necessary for us to argue for them and raise social awareness.",Pan Yuekun,1915,no,Funü zazhi (The Ladies' Journal),"Guangzhou,CN",23.15336590501664,113.5769600498724,University of Heidelberg,Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes. ,Image;StillImage,zh-Hant

ll002,linglong_vol001_issue01.jpg,the Ideology of not Marrying,image/jpeg,"This is an article from Linglong. Detailed content: ""If men are so quick to change their hearts, why would I marry one so easily and let him ruin me? And so many men just see women as toys...Then there are the so-called trendy men, living off their fathers or inherited wealth—who knows if it was earned honestly or through shady means—and they flaunt it to impress women. But if a woman marries one of them, and he loses all his money, with no talent or skill to fall back on, what would happen to me then? That’s why I want to keep studying for a few more years and find a place for myself in society. So, I’ve decided—I’m never getting married.""",Yang Yizhu,1932,no,Linglong (Elegance/La Petite),Shenzhen，CN,22.547214762282866,114.07988710978937,University of Heidelberg,Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes. ,Image;StillImage,zh-Hant

Detailed content: Bing Xin, a renowned writer in Chinese literary, once taught at Yenching University and is now preparing for a visit to the United States for academic research. Recently, she received a invitation from the female students of Yenching University to give a lecture at the Mudean Girls' School. Bing Xin gladly accepted and delivered a speech titled ""My Middle School Life."" In her lecture, Bing Xin spoke of her feelings during her time at Beiman Girls' School, where she developed a bond with her math teacher, Ding Shujing, that went beyond ordinary friendship. Ms. Ding was gentle, tall, and elegant, with both beauty and talent. She offered Bing Xin care and encouragement. Bing Xin admired her teacher deeply and felt a mixture of reverence and shyness. She cared for Ms. Ding and expressed her feelings through small gestures, while also pouring her affections into her poetry and writing. However, due to the difference in their social status and her respect for the teacher's career, Bing Xin chose to keep these feelings hidden. In her lecture, Bing Xin discussed the concept of ""same-sex love"" and shared her thoughts on how women perceive romantic relationships.
